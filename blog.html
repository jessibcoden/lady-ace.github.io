				<p>Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing.</p>

				<p>I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong?</p>

				<p>Uncle Gob, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break. But it wasn't. Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. That coat costs more than your house!</p>

				<p>Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 Emmys and was still canceled early by Fox? COME ON. When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. He's going to be all right. However, she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol suggestion.</p>

				<p>Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you.</p>

				<p>You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror.</p>

				<p>Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass! You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on!</p>

				<p>Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. - Lucille Bluth. No one was making fun of Andy Griffith. I can't emphasize that enough. Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself. Hop on? Obviously this blue part here is the land. Let me out that Queen. You boys know how to shovel coal?</p>

				<p>Family Love Michael. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it. You'd do that to your own brother? I said "cot." Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. Am I in two thirds of a hospital room? You can control your bladder when you're dead!</p>

				<p>Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. ♪♪ And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting. Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight! ♪♪ First I blow him, then I poke him. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! Family Love Michael. Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes.</p>
